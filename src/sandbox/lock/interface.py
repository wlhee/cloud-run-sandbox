"""
Defines the abstract interface for a distributed, asynchronous lock.

This module provides the `LockInterface` abstract base class, which serves as a
contract for all lock implementations within the application. This allows for
pluggable locking strategies (e.g., a real GCS-based lock or a fake in-memory
lock for testing) and promotes a clean, decoupled architecture.

    An interface for a distributed, asynchronous, advisory lock.

        Asynchronously acquires the lock, waiting if necessary.

        If the lock is held, this method attempts to become the single designated
        "waiter". If another process is already waiting, this method will fail fast.
        Upon successful acquisition, the lock will automatically renew its lease
        in the background until `release()` is called.
