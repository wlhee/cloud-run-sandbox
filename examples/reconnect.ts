/*
 * This example demonstrates the automatic reconnection feature of the Cloud Run Sandbox client.
 *
 * How this example is set up:
 * 1. We connect to a Cloud Run service that has a configured stream timeout of 5 seconds.
 *    This means the connection will be closed every 5 seconds.
 * 2. The client creates a sandbox with debug logging enabled to provide verbose output.
 * 3. After the sandbox is created, it executes a long-running script that prints a number every second for 20 seconds.
 * 4. During this 20-second execution, the 5-second stream timeout on the Cloud Run service will be exceeded.
 * 5. The client will detect the disconnection and automatically reconnect to the sandbox.
 * 6. You can observe the reconnection process in the debug logs, and the script's output will continue uninterrupted.
 *
 * Session Affinity:
 * This example also demonstrates the session affinity feature. When the client first connects to the Cloud Run service,
 * the service returns a `GAESA` cookie. The client automatically captures this cookie and includes it in all subsequent
 * requests, ensuring that reconnection attempts are routed to the same Cloud Run instance. This is crucial for
 * maintaining the sandbox session. You can observe the cookie being received and used in the debug logs.
 *
 * To run this example:
 * 1. Make sure you have ts-node installed (`npm install -g ts-node`).
 * 2. Set the environment variable for your Cloud Run service URL:
 *    `export CLOUD_RUN_URL="wss://your-service-url.run.app"
 * 3. Run the script from the root of the repository:
 *    `npx ts-node example/reconnect.ts`
