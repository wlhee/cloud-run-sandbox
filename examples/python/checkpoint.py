    This example demonstrates the checkpoint and restore functionality.

    It performs the following steps:
    1. Creates a new sandbox on one server instance.
    2. Executes a command to create a file in the sandbox.
    3. Checkpoints the sandbox.
    4. Attaches to the same sandbox ID from a different client, potentially
       on a different server instance, which triggers a restore.
    5. Executes a command to verify that the file exists.

    SERVER-SIDE REQUIREMENTS:
    To run this example, the Cloud Run service must be deployed with a persistent
    volume (e.g., a GCS bucket) and the `CHECKPOINT_AND_RESTORE_PATH` environment
    variable set to the mount path of that volume.

    This script expects the URLs of your deployed Cloud Run services to be
    set in environment variables. For a local test, you can use the same URL for both.

    The WebSocket URLs should be in the format: wss://<your-cloud-run-url>

    To run this example:
    1. Set the environment variables:
       `export CLOUD_RUN_URL_CHECKPOINT="wss://your-service-a-url.run.app"
       `export CLOUD_RUN_URL_RESTORE="wss://your-service-b-url.run.app"
    2. Run the script from the root of the repository:
       `python3 example/python/checkpoint.py`
    """
    url_checkpoint = os.environ.get("CLOUD_RUN_URL_CHECKPOINT").replace("https://", "wss://")
    url_restore = os.environ.get("CLOUD_RUN_URL_RESTORE").replace("https://", "wss://")

    if not url_checkpoint or not url_restore:
        print("Error: Please set the CLOUD_RUN_URL_CHECKPOINT and CLOUD_RUN_URL_RESTORE environment variables.")
