    This example demonstrates the filesystem snapshot functionality of the Cloud Run Sandbox.

    It performs the following steps:
    1. Creates a new sandbox.
    2. Executes a command to write a file to the sandbox's filesystem.
    3. Creates a snapshot of the sandbox's filesystem.
    4. Creates a new sandbox from the snapshot.
    5. Executes a command to read the file, verifying that the state was restored.

    SERVER-SIDE REQUIREMENTS:
    To run this example, the Cloud Run service must be deployed with a persistent
    volume (e.g., a GCS bucket) and the `FILESYSTEM_SNAPSHOT_PATH` environment
    variable set to the mount path of that volume.

    This script expects the URL of your deployed Cloud Run service to be
    set in the `CLOUD_RUN_URL` environment variable.

    The WebSocket URL should be in the format: wss://<your-cloud-run-url>

    To run this example:
    1. Set the environment variable:
       `export CLOUD_RUN_URL="https://your-service-url.run.app"`
    2. Install the Python client for the sandbox:
       `pip install clients/python/`
    3. Run the script from the root of the repository:
       `CLOUD_RUN_URL=<URL> python3 examples/filesystem_snapshot.py`
